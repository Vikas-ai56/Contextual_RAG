Based on the policy documents provided, here is a comprehensive analysis of the coverage for your thyroid treatment.

### **Analysis of Coverage**

**1. Is this condition covered?**

The provided evidence does not explicitly list "thyroid" conditions as a general exclusion. Therefore, based solely on the text supplied, there is no information to suggest the condition is not covered.

**2. What is the waiting period for this condition?**

The policy outlines a "Specified disease/procedure waiting period" for a list of specific conditions.

*   **Evidence:** According to Clause 4.2.f, there is a 90-day waiting period for Hypertension, Diabetes, and Cardiac conditions, and a one-year waiting period for Benign ENT disorders, Tonsillectomy, and Adenoidectomy.
*   **Conclusion:** "Thyroid" is not mentioned in the "List of specific diseases/procedures" that are subject to a waiting period.

**3. Could this be considered a pre-existing disease?**

The policy has a specific definition for a pre-existing disease which could affect coverage.

*   **Evidence:** Clause 2.44 defines a pre-existing disease as any condition that was diagnosed, or for which medical advice or treatment was received, within 36 months prior to the policy's start date.
*   **Conclusion:** Whether your thyroid condition is considered pre-existing depends on when it was first diagnosed or treated in relation to the start date of your policy. The information you provided does not allow for a determination of its pre-existing status.
